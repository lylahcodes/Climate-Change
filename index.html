        <h1>Welcome to Climate Change Awareness</h1>
        <p>The goal of this website is to educate people on the harmful effects climate change is causing to our planet and to the life that lives on it. The reason this website was created was to serve as a tool others can use and loook back on to properly educate and learn more about this important and very pressing topic that effects all of our lives.</p>

        <h2>What is the difference between climate and weather?</h2>
        <p>Climate and weather are very different because it's measured over a long period of time while weather can change from one day to another. Climate change is a long term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a certain place. </p>

        <h2>What is the US government doing to stop it?</h2>
        <p>-The US governments Biden administration has set a goal for the US to get too zero carbon
emissions by the year 2050 and has outlined a plan to help promote clean energy. Which
includes investments into renewable energy sources and research and development.</p>

        <h2>What are international governments doing? </h2>
        <p>Other countries in the world have been doing there fair share to help stop climate change to. For example the
UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, to help accelerate action towards the goals of
the Paris Agreement as well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This has helped brought
prominent leaders from around the world to discuss this issue. Canada has started too try to reach the goal of
getting net-zero emissions by the year 2050. They have also implemented polices to help reduce the amount of
power produced by coal and other fossil fuels and has invested in renewable energy. The European Union has
been working on fighting climate change by agreeing to the Paris Agreement.</p>

        <h2>What are some causes of climate change? </h2>
        <p>There are some natural causes of climate change for example like volcanic eruptions, solar
radiation, tectonic shifts, and even some small changes in our orbit. But most of the climate
change we see today has come from human causes. Like the burning of fossil fuels which put
chemicals like carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. As well as teh chopping down and destruction
of natural habitats like wetlands and forests. By constantly pumping these chemicals into our
atmosphere we have brought up the average temperatue by about 1.9 degrees farenhheit. The
cars, trucks, ships, plane etc that we use to transport ourselves are a very large cause of the
greenhouse emissions we are seeing. As well as the burning of fossil fuels to create energy,
about 60% percent of the electricity that is used currently in the USA is produced by burning
coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The factories and faciloties that our goods are produced
in are also significant sources of green house gases. To be able toc reate the products that
people demand for they end up burning through massive amounts of energy and electricity.
Agriculture also releases about 11% of the greenhouse gasses released here in the US. Other
causes include: building, oil and gas development, deforestation, and our lifestyle choices.</p>

        <h2>What are some effects we might experience in a few years? </h2>
        <p>Some effects we might experience due to climate change in a few years, is the US sea level might rise 1-6.6 feet
by 2100. This can cause increased flooding and their might be some land that sinks along the coastlines. Other
effects might be a warmer atmosphere, our oceans becoming more acidic and warmer, sea levels raising, and
larger changes in the Earths precipitation patterns. Other results might be an increase in Earths average
temperature, a reduction in ice and snow cover, more intense and frequent extreme events, and increased
threats to the health of humans.</p>

        <h2>What can people do to stop climate change?</h2>
        <p>A few things people can do to help stop climate change are, urge the gov to take immediate
action against climate change. Use energy and eletricity wisely so that we are using less
greenhouse gases. Stop using cars , trucks , etc and instead use environmentally friendly
transport like bikes or public transport. Consume less and create less waste. Use more
renewable energy sources such as solar panels.</p>

        <h2> Where are the effects of climate change felt the most? </h2></h2>
        <p>Some of the most vulnerable places where climate change is felt the most are the country
Chad, for example in late 2022 flooding affected more than 1 million of the people in the country
while they were already going through an economic crisis. Which has led to widespread food
insecurity. Another country that is vulnerable to climate change is South Sudan, which is a
country with very high fragility and is increasingly vulnerable to climate disasters. They had a
civil war that ended in 2018 which rocked the country. One more country that is also vulnerable
is Nigeria, some flooding in late 2022 affected 2.5 million people and caused alot of damage to
the countrys farmland.</p>

        <h2>What are some effects that we are currently experiencing due to climate change?</h2>
        <p>Due to climate change there has been more in tense droughts, storms, heat
waves, rising sea levels and melting glaciers. All of these things have harmed
animals and the communities people live in. Dangerous weather has become more
frequent and severe like heat waves, forest fires, coastal storms and flooding. There
have been higher temperatures the last decade has been one of the hottest ever
recorded. Due to these higher tempetures wildfires are more likely and can spread
more easily. These higher tempatures also have led to more intense and severe
storms. They have also lead to food shortages because the increased temperatures
have led to crops and livestock to be destroyed or have become less productive.
Climate change also has a negative impact on health due to air polution, water
pollution etc.</p>
